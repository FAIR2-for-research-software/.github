# FAIR<sup>2</sup> for research software

This training curriculum offers a modular programme to support researchers in applying FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and open research practices to their
research software. The overview module provides an introduction to FAIR for research software and
gives an overview of the topics that are offered in more detail in additional modules, which can be
selected according to an individualâ€™s learning goals.

The course materials in this organisation are made available as open educational resources for
ongoing use at the University of Sheffield and in the wider community.
